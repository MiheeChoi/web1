  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
  is an information system where documents and<br> other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators,<br>
  which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.</p>
  <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), <br>
  may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.<br>
  The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.</p>
